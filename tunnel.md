Common Formats

Base 2 - Lowest level format and is the base language used by computer systems. Uses a series of "0" and "1" in groupings of 8-bits or 1 byte.

01000010 01100001 01110011 01100101 00100000 00110010

Base 10 - Basis for the numbering system used by humans.

66 97 115 101 32 49 48

Base 16 - Used by computers and humans to express larger decimal numbers or long streams of binary into more manageable groupings.

42 61 73 65 20 31 36

Base 64 - Like HEX, it allows groupings up to 6-bits of binary (0-63 decimal). Characters used are (A-Z), (a-z), (0-9), and (+, /). That is (26) + (26) + (10) + (2) respectively. 
In order to be compatible with binary, it uses 4 groupings of 6-bits (24 total bits) so that it will equate to 3 bytes of binary ( 24 bits). For data not consuming the full 24-bits, 
it will use "=" signs for each 6 unused bits at the end as padding.

OSI MODEL ######
https://net.cybbh.io/public/networking/latest/lesson-1-fundamentals/_images/OSI.png

Web Request Example

Application Layer: A user requests their browser to download a file from a web site. The HTTP protocol handler at this layer recognizes the secure request for a file on the web server and passes the request to the TLS Library.
#data#

Session and Presentation Layer: The TLS library needs to create a secure channel for communication which requires the establishment of a connection with the destination. It passes a connection request to TCP.
#data#

Transport Layer: The TCP handler receives the connection requests and creates a segment with the SYN flag (first part of the three-way handshake) set to the distant end server. The upper layer data is encapsulated with a TCP header and the segment is passed down to IP at the network layer.
#TCP# has to have 3 way handshake   #UDP# does not three way handshake  #segment#

Network Layer: The network layer receives the segment and creates a packet by encapsulating the TCP header and data payload in an IP header. The correct IP information is added to the header for the destination IP address. The packet is then passed down to the Data-Link layer.
#packet#

Data-Link Layer: The data-link layer creates a frame encapsulating the data payload, TCP header, and IP header. The destination MAC address of the router is added to send the frame to it’s local destination. In addition to a header a trailer/footer is added containing a checksum and padding if needed to aid in frame synchronization. This is then passed to the physical layer.
#frame#

Physical Layer: The physical layer takes the binary data and injects it onto the physical media for which transmission is taking place (wireless or wired)
#bits#

Data Link Sub-layers

Data link layer is unique because it has the function to communicate in "logical" and "physical". 
To accommodate this the functionality of this layer is divided into two logical sub-layers. 
An upper sub-layer, LLC, to interact with the network layer above and a lower sub-layer, MAC, to interact with the physical layer.

MAC (Media Access Control)

Act as a sublayer governing protocol access to the physical medium, physical addressing, and acts as an interface between the LLC and physical layer. 
Most of the frame construction happens at this layer.

LLC (Logical Link Control)

Manages communication between devices over a single link of the network that includes error checking and data flow. 
This layer provides the Ethertype to the MAC sublayer in the frame construction to identify the encapsulated protocol.

###############################################
Presentation Layer (OSI Layer 6)

Presentation Layer — This layer deals with the Translating, Formatting, Encryption, and Compression of data.

Translation - The presentation layer is responsible for interoperability between encoding methods as different computers use different encoding methods. 
It translates data between the formats the network requires and the format at the computer.

Formatting - This layer is responsible to put the file in a format that is readable. Such as:

ASCII or EBCDIC
.doc, .ppt or .xls
mp3 or wav
avi or mp4
bmp, jpeg, gif, tiff or png


Encryption This is the layer the encryption and decryption gets carried out.
Symetric: AES, Blowfish, Twofish, DES, and RC4
Asymetric: PKI, Deffie-Hellman, DSS, RSA, Elliptic curve

Compression Sometimes data gets to big to transmit over the network so The Presentation layer handles compression.T
he primary role of Data compression is to reduce the number of bits to be transmitted. 
It is important in transmitting multimedia such as audio, video, text etc.
Zip, TAR, RAR, 7zip, CAB

FTP (TCP 20/21)
https://net.cybbh.io/public/networking/latest/lesson-1-fundamentals/_images/ftp.png
FTP
Published in RFC 959, File Transfer Protocol is a standard network protocol that is used for file transfer between a client and a server. 
Authentication is performed via a username and password, but can also be disabled in favor of anonymous mode if the FTP server is configured for it. 
The drawback with FTP is that all communication is clear text, including the initial authentication.

FTP has two modes of operation, Active and Passiv

Active
A client initiates a connection with a server on port 21 from the client’s ephemeral high port. 
The three way handshake is completed and the client listens on it’s ephemeral high port + 1, the client sends the port N+1 command to the server on port 21 (control port). 
Ex: if the command to the server is from ephemeral port 1026, it would listen on port 1027. 
Once that is done, the server initiates a connection to the client’s ephemeral high (1027) from the server’s data port (20) and the data is transferred.
## active is bad becuse the server it might not be allowed to send you data due to firewalls or ports. the server cant connect to your open port always ##
https://net.cybbh.io/public/networking/latest/lesson-1-fundamentals/_images/ftp_active.png

Passive
Passive FTP sidesteps the issue of Active mode by reversing the conversation. The client initiates both the command and data connections.
##passive mode is better becuse you have to reachout to the ftp server and grab the data from there random high port so that the firewall wont block it and you go out to grab it##
https://net.cybbh.io/public/networking/latest/lesson-1-fundamentals/_images/ftp_passive.png

SSH (TCP 22)
https://net.cybbh.io/public/networking/latest/lesson-1-fundamentals/_images/ssh.png
SSH Protocol
SSH is an open protocol with many different implementations. Examples include PuTTy, Solaris Secure Shell, Bitvise, and OpenSSH. 
OpenSSH is the open source implementation that is most common and the focus of this course as it is widely found in Linux and Unix. 
Support for Windows was introduced when OpenSSH was ported to run in Windows Power Shell in 2015. It is included in Windows 10 as of 2018, though it must be enabled in settings.

ssh allows you to secure copy --- scp 
allows tunnling 
secure shell to run commands 

#####SSH Architecture######
https://net.cybbh.io/public/networking/latest/lesson-1-fundamentals/_images/ssh.png

Components of SSH Architecture
In order for ssh to work properly between a client and server, several components are required:

Server
Known as sshd in most linux SSH implementations, this allows incoming SSH connections and handles authentication and authorization.

Clients
This is the program that connects to the SSH server for a request, examples include scp and ssh

Sessions
The client and server conversation that begins after successful mutual authentication.

Keys
There are several keys that are used in SSH:

User Key - Asymmetric Public key created used to identify the user to a server (generated by the user)
Host Key - Asymmetric Public key created to identify a server to a user (generated by an administrator)
Session Key - Symmetric Key created by the client and the server that protects the communication for a particular session

Key Generator
Creates user keys and host keys via ssh-keygen

Known-hosts database
Collection of host keys that the client and server refer to for mutual authentication.

Agent
Stores keys in memory as a convenience for users to not input pass-phrases repetitively.

Signer
This is a program that signs the host-based authentication packets.

Random Seed
Random data used for entropy in creating pseudo-random numbers

Configuration File
Settings that exist on either the client or server that dictate functionality for ssh or sshd respectively

LAYER 3 ROUTING TECHNOLOGIES



Routing Table
The primary functions of a router are to:

Determine the best path to send packets

Forward packets toward their destination





ROUTING TABLES
Ultimate route is any routing table entry that has a next-hop IPv4 address, exit interface, or both.

Level 1 route is any route with the subnet mask (CIDR) is equal to or less than the classful mask of the network address. A level 1 route can be a:

Network route - A network route that has a subnet mask equal to that of the classful mask.

Class A - 255.0.0.0 (/8)

Class B - 255.255.0.0 (/16)

Class C - 255.255.255.0 (/24)

Supernet route - A network route with a mask less (smaller) than the classful mask.

Default route - A default route is a static route with the address 0.0.0.0/0.

Parent route is a level 1 network that is subnetted. A parent route will never be an ultimate route.

Level 2 child route are the subnets of a classful network address.
https://detailed.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/subnet-chart.jpg



LOOKUP PROCESS
Best Route = Longest Match

Routers compares the destination address in the incoming packet to its entries in the routing table.
It matches the address (bit by bit) to all the table entries and looks for the longest bit match it can find. 
Starting at the far left, it compares the bits up to the amounts of bits in the CIDR mask. 
(i.e. a /12 mask will match 12 bits and a /24 will match 24 bits.)


Routed vs Routing Protocols

Routed protocol is a protocol that allows data to be routed. 
These protocols provide an addressing scheme and sub-netting. 
The addressing scheme identifies the individual host and the network to which it belongs. 
Each host address bust be unique. All hosts on an internetwork must use the services of a routed protocol to communicate.

IPv4

IPv6

IPX

AppleTalk



Routing Protocol are used by routers communicate routing information with each other. 
Unless all routes are manually entered into the router, the router needs to learn from other routers about the networks that they know. 
They use this shared information to populate their routing tables so that they can make better decisions when forwarding routed protocols such as IPv4.

Routing protocols are broken down to 2 types:

            Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) - is a type of protocol used for exchanging routing information between gateways (commonly routers) within an autonomous system

                        RIP (v1, v2, ng)

                        EIGRP and EIGRP or IPv6

                        OSPF (v2 and v3)

                        IS-IS

            Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) - is a routing protocol used to exchange routing information between autonomous systems

                        BGP




First Hop Redundancy Protocols

Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) - A Cisco-proprietary FHRP designed to allow for transparent fail-over of IPv4 networks. 
One router interface will be set as "active" and the others set as "standby". Once the active interface will forward traffic to other networks. 
Standby interfaces serve as backups in case the active fails. Active interface sends multicast "Hello" packets to inform the backups that its still operational.

HSRP for IPv6 - Cisco-proprietary FHRP providing the same functionality as HSRP but for IPv6 addressing.

Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol version 2 (VRRPv2) - An open-standard FHRP similar to HSRP. Assigns the "Master" as the active forwarder and "backups".

VRRPv3 - VRRP for IPv6 addressing.

Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP) - another Cisco-proprietary FHRP like HSRP but adds the ability to have more than one Active forwarder. 
Incorporates the ability to load balance over all active interfaces rather than using just 1.

GLBP for IPv6 - CGLBP for IPv6 addressing.




Static vs Dynamic Routing
https://git.cybbh.space/net/public/raw/master/modules/networking/slides/images/AD.png


Routing protocols can learn of 2 or more routes to the same destination network. 
To determine which one is the "shortest", routing protocol uses metrics to determine the best path to a destination network. 
Routing protocols each uses different factors as its metrics to determine the best/shortest routes.

Some of the most common metrics that routing protocols can use are:

hop

bandwidth

delay

reliability

load

MTU

cost

administratively defined



Static Routing
            Static routing provides some advantages over dynamic routing, including:

                        Static routes do not advertise over the network, resulting in better security.

                        Static routes do not use bandwidth like dynamic routing protocols to send updates and no CPU cycles are used to calculate and communicate routes.

                        The path a static route uses to send data is predetermined.



            Static routing has the following disadvantages:

                        Initial configuration and maintenance is time-consuming.

                        Configuration is prone to error, especially on large networks.

                        Administrator must intervene to update routing information or to bypass network faults.

                        Does not scale well with growing networks; maintenance becomes cumbersome.

                        Requires complete knowledge of the whole network for proper implementation.



Dynamic Routing

Routing protocols allow routers to dynamically exchange routing information to build routing tables. 
If 2 or more routers share the same protocol they can communicate with each other. The purpose of dynamic routing protocols includes:

            Discover new remote networks

            Maintaining current routing information

            Choose best path to remote networks
            
            Recalculate a new patch to a remote network should the primary fail

Dynamic routing provides some advantages over static routing, including:

            Easier to configure and maintain.

            Administrator does not need to intervene to update tables during network outages.

            Scales very well on growing networks.

            Dynamic routing has the following disadvantages:
            
            Routing protocols flood the network updates which consumes bandwidth and can be intercepted.

            Uses extensive CPU and RAM to run its algorithms and build its databases.

            Path data can travel is not deterministic and can change fluidly.

Advertises IP CIDR address blocks

Establishes Peer relationships

Complicated configuration

Complicated and slow path selection




BGP OPERATION
How BGP chooses the best path:

Advertise a more specific route. 192.168.1.0 /24 is more specific than 192.168.0.0 /16.

Offer a shorter route to certain blocks of IP addresses. A route to ip prefix with 4 AS 'hops" is better than route with 5 AS 'hops'


BGP HIJACKING
Illegitimate advertising of addresses

BGP propagates false information

Purpose:

stealing prefixes

monitoring traffic

intercept (and possibly modify) Internet traffic

'black holing' traffic

perform MitM

tcp dump 
-X or -XX     some dumb shit with dump
-XXvv     double verbose options and more info / integrety cheching
-XXvvn 
-XXvvn -w     writes to a pcap file then name file right after 
-XXnnn -r     then write the name of the pcap

BERKELEY PACKET FILTERS (BPF)
Requests a SOCK_RAW socket and setsockopt calls SO_ATTACH_FILTER

sock = socket(PF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW, htons(ETH_P_ALL))
...
setsockopt(sock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ATTACH_FILTER, ...)


BERKELEY PACKET FILTERS
Using BPFs with operators, bitmasking, and TCPDump creates a powerful tool for traffic filtering and parsing.

tcpdump {A} [B:C] {D} {E} {F} {G}

A = Protocol (ether | arp | ip | ip6 | icmp | tcp | udp)
B = Header Byte offset
C = optional: Byte Length. Can be 1, 2 or 4 (default 1)
D = optional: Bitwise mask (&)
E = Operator (= | == | > | < | <= | >= | != | () | << | >>)
F = Result of Expresion
G = optional: Logical Operator (&& ||) to bridge expressions

Example:
tcpdump 'ether[12:2] = 0x0800 && (tcp[2:2] != 22 && tcp[2:2] != 23)'

BITWISE MASKING
To filter down to the bit(s) and not just the byte.

ip[0] & 0x0F > 0x05
ver ihl bpf
FILTER LOGIC - MOST EXCLUSIVE
All designated bit values must be set; no others can be set

tcp[13] = 0x11
--or--
tcp[13] & 0xFF = 0x11

SOCKET TYPES
Stream Sockets - Connection oriented and sequenced; methods for connection establishment and tear-down. Used with TCP, SCTP, and Bluetooth.

Datagram Sockets - Connectionless; designed for quickly sending and receiving data. Used with UDP.

Raw Sockets - Direct sending and receiving of IP packets without automatic protocol-specific formatting.


USER SPACE VS. KERNEL SPACE SOCKETS
     User Space Sockets

            Stream Sockets

            Datagram Sockets

    Kernel Space Sockets

            Raw Sockets


SOCKET CREATION AND PRIVILEGE LEVEL
User Space Sockets - The most common sockets that do not require elevated privileges to perform actions on behalf of user applications.

Kernel Space Sockets - Attempts to access hardware directly on behalf of a user application to either prevent encapsulation/decapsulation or to create packets from scratch, which requires elevated privileges.


USER SPACE APPLICATIONS/SOCKETS
Using tcpdump or wireshark to read a file

Using nmap with no switches

Using netcat to connect to a listener

Using netcat to create a listener above the well known port range(1024+)

Using /dev/tcp or /dev/udp to transmit data




KERNEL SPACE APPLICATIONS/SOCKETS
Using tcpdump or wireshark to capture packets on the wire

Using nmap for OS identification or to set specific flags when scanning

Using netcat to create a listener in the well known port range (0 - 1023)

Using Scapy to craft or modify a packet for transmission

Using Python to craft or modify Raw Sockets for transmission

Network devices using routing protocols such as OSPF

NETWORK PROGRAMMING WITH PYTHON3
Network sockets primarily use the Python3 Socket library and socket.socket function.

import socket
  s = socket.socket(socket.FAMILY, socket.TYPE, socket.PROTOCOL)
THE SOCKET.SOCKET FUNCTION
Inside the socket.socket. function, you have these arguments, in order:

socket.socket([*family*[,*type*[*proto*]]])
family constants should be: AF_INET (default), AF_INET6, AF_UNIX

type constants should be: SOCK_STREAM (default), SOCK_DGRAM, SOCK_RAW

proto constants should be: 0 (default), IPPROTO_RAW

IPTABLES SYNTAX
iptables -t [table] -A [chain] [rules] -j [action]
Rules:

-i or -o [iface]
-s or -d [ip.add | network/mask]
-p [protocol(in ipv4 header)]

-m is used with:
  state --state [state]
  mac [--mac-source | --mac-destination] [mac]
  tcp | udp [--dport | --sport] [port | port1:port2]
  multiport [--sports | --dports | --ports]
                [port1,[port2,[port3:port15]]]
  bpf --bytecode [ 'bytecode' ]

[action] - ACCEPT, REJECT, DROP


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

MODIFY IPTABLES
Flush table

iptables -t [table] -F
Change default policy

iptables -t [table] -P [chain] [action]
Lists rules with rule numbers

iptables -t [table] -L --line-numbers
Lists rules as commands interpreted by the system

iptables -t [table] -S
Inserts rule before Rule number

iptables -t [table] -I [chain] [rule num] [rules] -j [action]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
NFTABLE
1. CREATE THE TABLE
nft add table [family] [table]
[family] = ip, ip6, inet, arp, bridge and netdev.

[table] = user provided name for the table.




2. CREATE THE BASE CHAIN
nft add chain [family] [table] [chain] { type [type] hook [hook]
    priority [priority] \; policy [policy] \;}
[chain] = User defined name for the chain.

[type] =  can be filter, route or nat.

[hook] = prerouting, ingress, input, forward, output or
         postrouting.

[priority] = user provided integer. Lower number = higher
             priority. default = 0. Use "--" before
             negative numbers.

; [policy] ; = set policy for the chain. Can be
              accept (default) or drop.

 Use "\" to escape the ";" in bash




3. CREATE A RULE IN THE CHAIN
nft add rule [family] [table] [chain] [matches (matches)] [statement]
[matches] = typically protocol headers(i.e. ip, ip6, tcp,
            udp, icmp, ether, etc)

(matches) = these are specific to the [matches] field.

[statement] = action performed when packet is matched. Some
              examples are: log, accept, drop, reject,
              counter, nat (dnat, snat, masquerade)



MODIFY NFTABLES
nft {list | flush} ruleset
nft {delete | list | flush } table [family] [table]
nft {delete | list | flush } chain [family] [table] [chain]



MODIFY NFTABLES
nft list table [family] [table] [-a]
Adds after position

nft add rule [family] [table] [chain] [position <position>] [matches (matches)] [statement]
Inserts before position

nft insert rule [family] [table] [chain] [position <position>] [matches (matches)] [statement]
Replaces rule at handle

nft replace rule [family] [table] [chain] [handle <handle>] [matches (matches)] [statement]
Deletes rule at handle

nft delete rule [family] [table] [chain] [handle <handle>]
